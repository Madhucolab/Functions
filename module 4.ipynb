    "#2.Explain the concept of funtion arguments and parameters in python?\n",
    "Ans:-Arguments An argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is\n",
    "called. It might be a variable, value or object passed to a function or method as input.\n",
    "Arguments are the actual values that you pass to the function when you call it. These\n",
    "values replace the parameters defined in the function.\n",
    "example:\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "# Here the values 5,3 are arguments\n",
    "print(add(5, 3))  \n",

    "Ans:-A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and it “returns” \n",
    "the value of the expression following the return keyword to the caller. \n",
    "The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, \n",

    "#5.What are iterators in python and how do they differ from iterables.\n",
    "Ans:-An iterator in Python is an object that holds a sequence of values and provide sequential traversal through a collection of items such as lists,\n",
    "tuples and dictionaries.The Python iterators object is initialized using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration..\n",
    "An Iterable  is basically an object that any user can iterate over. \n",
    "An Iterator is also an object that helps a user in iterating over another object (that is iterable). \n",
    "We can generate an iterator when we pass the object to the iter() method.\n",

    "#6.Explain the concept of generators in python and how they are defined.\n",
    "Ans:- A generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator\n",
    "object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use\n",
    "yield to produce a series of results over time. This allows the function to generate\n",
    "values and pause its execution after each yield, maintaining its state between\n",
    "iterations.\n",
    " example:\n",
    "def fun(max):\n",
    "    cnt = 1\n",
    "    while cnt <= max:\n",
    "        yield cnt\n",

    "        5\n",
    "explain:-This generator function fun yields numbers from 1 up to a\n",
    "specified max. Each call to next() on the generator object resumes execution right after the\n",
    "yield statement, where it last left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7.What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions.\n",
    "Ans:-1. Efficient Memory usage: Generators do not store the entire sequence in\n",
    "memory, making them suitable for large datasets or infinite sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simpler syntex: Using yield simplifies the creation of iterators, making the code\n",
    "more concise and readble.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. speed: Generators can be faster than regular loops because they avoid the\n",
    "overhead of creating a list or other data structure to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. lazy evaluation: Generators can produce a sequence of values on the fly, which\n",
    "allows for lazy evaluation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. flexibiity: Generators can generate data dynamically, allowing for\n",
    "more flexibility in your code.\n",
    "example:\n",

    "#8.What is a lambda function in python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "Ans:-A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. \n",
    "Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions are written in a single line and are often used for short,\n",
    "simple operations.\n",
    "Syntax of a Lambda Function:lambda arguments: expression\n",
